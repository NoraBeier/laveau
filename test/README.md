# Atom-to-Atom Mapping Comparison: Lavaeu vs. RXNMapper

This repository presents a comparative study of **Atom-to-Atom Maps (AAMs)** generated by two different mapping tools: **Lavaeu** and **RXNMapper**.
The comparison is performed using the [**EEquAAM** tool](https://github.com/MarcosLaffitte/EEquAAM), which provides a systematic framework to evaluate the equivalence of atom mappings.

## Repository Structure

* **`map_list/`**
  Contains the AAMs generated by Lavaeu and RXNMapper for the reactions under study.

* **`scripts/`**
  Includes the scripts used to run the comparison between the two mapping approaches with the EEquAAM tool.

* **`results_EEquAAM/`**
  Output directory with all comparison results, including equivalence tests and mismatches between mappings.

* **`results_EEquAAM/noteq_maps.pdf`**
  Visualization of all AAMs where the mappings **differ** between Lavaeu and RXNMapper.
  This file provides a clear overview of reactions that yield non-equivalent atom mappings.

## Methodology

1. **AAM Generation**

   * Reaction atom-to-atom maps were first generated using Lavaeu.
   * The maps were then replaced by those generated with RXNMapper.
   * For comparability, explicit hydrogens were removed.
   * All resulting maps were stored in `map_list/`.

2. **Map Comparison with EEquAAM**

   * The [EEquAAM](https://github.com/MarcosLaffitte/EEquAAM) tool was applied to assess mapping equivalence.
   * The scripts in `scripts/` handle data formatting and the execution of comparisons.

3. **Results**

   * The directory `results_EEquAAM/` contains detailed outputs of the comparison runs.
   * All non-equivalent maps are summarized and visually documented in `noteq_maps.pdf`.
