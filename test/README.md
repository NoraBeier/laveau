# Atom-to-Atom Mapping Comparison: Lavaeu vs. RXNMapper

This repository contains a comparative study of **Atom-to-Atom Maps (AAMs)** generated by two different mapping tools: **Lavaeu** and **RXNMapper**.
The comparison is carried out using the [**EEquAAM** tool](https://github.com/MarcosLaffitte/EEquAAM), which enables a systematic evaluation of equivalence between mapping solutions.

## Repository Structure

* **`map_list/`**
  Contains the AAMs generated by Lavaeu and RXNMapper for the set of reactions under study.

* **`scripts/`**
  Scripts used to run the comparison between the two mapping approaches with the EEquAAM tool.

* **`results_EEquAAM/`**
  Output directory with all comparison results, including equivalence tests and mismatches between mappings.

* **`results_EEquAAM/noteq_maps.pdf`**
  A visualization of all AAMs where the mappings **differ** between Lavaeu and RXNMapper.
  This file provides an overview of reactions that yield non-equivalent atom mappings.

## Methodology

1. **AAM Generation**

   * Reaction AAMs were first generated using Lavaeu.
   * Then the AAMs where removed and recreated by RXNMapper
   * To be able to compare the Maps: Hydrogens have been also removed
   * The resulting maps were stored in `map_list/`.

2. **Map Comparison with EEquAAM**

   * The [EEquAAM](https://github.com/MarcosLaffitte/EEquAAM) tool was used to assess the equivalence of mappings.
   * Scripts located in `scripts/` handle the formatting and execution of the comparisons.

3. **Results**

   * The directory `results_EEquAAM/` contains detailed outputs of the comparison runs.
   * Non-equivalent maps are summarized and visualized in `noteq_maps.pdf`.
